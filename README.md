INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATION

1.  Customer demography and customer strength
Data was collected, analyzed, and visualized from the recently concluded survey to provide insight to guide business needs. The survey revealed that 388 respondents participated in the online customer preference survey with a total of 222 males and 166 females. 268 of the respondents are single, mostly students in age group ranging from 20 25 years with no income, and they account for 69.1% of the total respondents.
This foretells that subsequently; the customers would continue to fall into this category. To ensure continuous patronage from this category of customers, I would recommend the company have a budget friendly meal and a delivery discount on frequent orders specially for students.

3. Medium Order
There are two medium order Medium (P1) and Medium (P2)

The survey revealed that 358 of the customers prefer food delivery apps and this accounts for 92.2% of the customers' preference Medium (P1) while 5.7% would walk in, 1.3% would place a direct call, and 0.8% use web browser. I would recommend that the company improve its food delivery app user interface to be user friendly, lightweight, secure, and fast performance. This will encourage more users to subscribe to the app.
For  Medium (P2), the survey revealed 208 respondents which account for 53.6% of the total respondents prefer to place direct calls, 26.8% of respondents prefer to walk in and 19.6% use a web browser. The company should have hands on experience call handler to answer and take customers' orders and queries. This will reduce order mix match and wrong order delivery. Also, there should be a first person contact for all walk in customers, this will reduce their waiting time, and a standby online assistant for web browsers.

3. Meal Order

There are two meal order, Meal (P1) and Meal (P2).
The survey further reveals that 315 of the customers prefer non veg food for both lunch and dinner, whichn makes up 81.1% of the total meal (P1), and 17.8%
prefer veg food for both breakfast, lunch, and dinner while 0.8% and 0.02% prefer sweet and bakery respectively. In a similar vein, 294 customers prefer veg foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner which makes up 75.8% of the total meal (P2), 11.9% prefer sweet, 0.1% prefer ice cream/ cool drinks and 0.03% prefer bakery items. Given that both Meal order has considerably different preferences, the company should prioritize having a dedicated team of customer service personnel to take appropriate orders when requested.


4. Preference split of Medium
   
From the data analyzed, it was revealed that snack is the most preferred meal in preference (P1) and Veg foods for (P2). I would recommend to the company
that there should be constant production of snacks to meet its high demand, and all veg foods should be freshly prepared at their best quality.


5.  Delivery time, customer's location and hight quality package.
The survey revealed that 47.6% of the respondents indicated that they got their food delivered to them for  a longer time, 68.6% indicated that they live in busy areas and 39.2% affirm the need for important high quality packages.
To ensure quality delivery time, food gets delivered to customers fresh and hot, and customer satisfaction is met, I would recommend the company improve its
food package, and have additional resources in the logistics department to handle the higher demands in busy areas, re strategize delivery routes using Google Maps for real time monitoring, and partner with other delivery bodies like Uber Eats.
